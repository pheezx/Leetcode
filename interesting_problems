/*

Write an algorithm to compute the square root of a given non-negative number. Since the true square root of a number may have infinitely many digits, we bound the accuracy of the square root by a second parameter, called the error.

For a given number target and error e, find a square root x that satisfies the following:
math.abs(x**2 - target) < e

e.g. SquareRoot(target=100.0, error=2.0) = 
  9.9**2 = 98.01
